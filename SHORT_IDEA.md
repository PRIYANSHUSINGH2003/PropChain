# PropChain: AI-Driven Real Estate Tokenization & Marketplace

**Problem:**
Real estate investment is illiquid, expensive, and inaccessible to most. Thereâ€™s little transparency, and small investors are excluded.

**Solution:**
PropChain is a decentralized platform that lets property owners tokenize real estate as NFTs (CW721) or fungible tokens (CW20), enabling fractional ownership. These tokens are traded on a transparent marketplace. AI models provide real-time property valuation, risk assessment, and compliance checks. Revenue from rentals or sales is distributed automatically to token holders.

**Key Features:**
- Tokenize real estate as CW20/CW721 tokens
- On-chain marketplace for trading property tokens
- AI-powered valuation and compliance
- Automated revenue sharing via ADO splitters
- Transparent, auditable transactions

**Tech Stack:**
- Andromeda aOS, Cosmos SDK, CW20/CW721, Marketplace, Splitter, Vesting ADOs
- Python/ML for AI services
- React/Next.js frontend, Node.js/Python backend

**User Flow:**
- Owners: Register, KYC, tokenize property, list on marketplace, receive revenue
- Investors: Register, KYC, buy/trade tokens, receive income, track portfolio

**MVP Goal:**
A dApp where users can tokenize, list, and trade real estate assets, with AI-powered valuation and automated revenue sharing.
