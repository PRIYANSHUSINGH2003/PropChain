# PropChain

AI-Driven Real Estate Tokenization & Marketplace on Andromeda

## Overview
PropChain is a decentralized platform enabling fractional ownership and trading of real estate assets using blockchain and AI. Property owners tokenize assets as NFTs (CW721) or fungible tokens (CW20), which are traded on a transparent marketplace. AI models provide real-time valuation and compliance checks. Revenue is distributed automatically to token holders.

## Structure
- `contracts/` — Smart contracts (ADOs) for tokenization, marketplace, and revenue sharing
- `ai-services/` — AI microservices for valuation, compliance, and risk scoring
- `frontend/` — User-facing dApp (React/Next.js)
