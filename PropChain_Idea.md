# PropChain: AI-Driven Real Estate Tokenization & Marketplace on Andromeda

## Problem Statement
Real estate investment is traditionally illiquid, expensive, and inaccessible to most people. There’s a lack of transparency in valuation, ownership, and revenue distribution. Small investors are locked out, and asset management is opaque.

## Objective
PropChain aims to democratize real estate investment by making it accessible, transparent, and liquid for everyone. The vision is to create a global, AI-powered platform where anyone can invest in, trade, and benefit from real estate assets, regardless of their location or capital size. The goal is to unlock new capital flows, empower property owners, and provide investors with secure, data-driven opportunities.

## Solution Overview
PropChain is a decentralized platform that enables property owners to tokenize real estate assets as NFTs (CW721) or fungible tokens (CW20), fractionalize ownership, and list them on a transparent marketplace. AI models provide real-time property valuation, risk assessment, and compliance checks. Revenue from rentals or sales is distributed automatically via ADO splitters.

## Key Features
- **Tokenization:** Property owners mint tokens representing fractional ownership of real estate assets.
- **Marketplace:** Buy, sell, or trade property tokens on-chain using Andromeda’s Marketplace ADO.
- **AI Valuation:** Integrate AI models to assess property value, rental yield, and risk, updating token prices dynamically.
- **Automated Revenue Sharing:** Use Conditional Splitter and Vesting ADOs to distribute rental income or sale proceeds to token holders.
- **Compliance & KYC:** AI-powered compliance checks for regulatory requirements.
- **On-chain Transparency:** All transactions, ownership, and revenue flows are visible and auditable.

## Technical Implementation
- **Architecture:**
  - Smart contracts (ADOs) on Andromeda for tokenization, trading, and revenue distribution
  - AI microservices for valuation, compliance, and risk scoring (integrated via API)
  - Frontend dApp (React/Next.js) for user interaction
  - Backend (Node.js/Python) for off-chain data aggregation and AI model hosting
- **Tech Stack:**
  - Andromeda aOS, Cosmos SDK, CW20/CW721, Marketplace, Splitter, Vesting ADOs
  - Python/ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow) for AI
  - IPFS or decentralized storage for property documents
- **Security:**
  - Smart contract audits, on-chain verification, and secure KYC/AML processes

## User Flow
- **For Property Owners:**
  1. Register and complete KYC
  2. Submit property details and documents
  3. AI model evaluates property and suggests tokenization parameters
  4. Mint tokens (CW20/CW721) representing fractional ownership
  5. List tokens on the marketplace
  6. Receive proceeds and revenue distributions automatically
- **For Investors:**
  1. Register and complete KYC
  2. Browse available properties and AI-powered analytics
  3. Purchase or trade property tokens
  4. Receive rental income or sale proceeds via automated splitters
  5. Track portfolio and performance on the dashboard

## Applications
- **Primary:**
  - Fractional real estate investment for retail and institutional investors
  - Liquidity for property owners
- **Future Extensions:**
  - Tokenization of other real-world assets (art, collectibles, commodities)
  - Integration with DeFi protocols for lending/borrowing against property tokens
  - Cross-chain asset management and trading

## Roadmap
- **MVP (Hackathon):**
  - Tokenization, marketplace, AI valuation, and revenue sharing for real estate
- **Post-Hackathon:**
  - Onboard real-world property partners
  - Expand AI models for more accurate and global valuations
  - Integrate advanced compliance and risk management
  - Explore partnerships with DeFi and asset management platforms
- **Scaling:**
  - Support for additional asset classes
  - Global expansion and regulatory compliance
